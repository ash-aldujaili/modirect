# The MO-DIRECT algorithm for Multi-Objective Black-Box Optimization

This repository hosts the code and slides for the multi-objective dividing rectangles algorithm. Paper can be found [here](http://atmri.ntu.edu.sg/Publications/Documents/Cognitive_team_theoretic/5%20Dividing%20Rectangles%20Attack%20Multi-Objective%20Optimization.pdf).


# Contents

The algorithm is implemented in `MATLAB` and there is also a `C`-implementation (though not thoroughly tested).


To run a demo, in `MATLAB`, `cd` to the directory and execute the following
```
>>run_MODIRECT_Demo
```
